Hash class is reposible for all the operation including the hashing, from converting a kmer to two hash part and remaining part, writing a kmer, compare two remaining parts of a kmer and return the hashed kmer to the original one

So, the Hash object needs to take only a string hash as a parameter (string of 16_'#' and 15_'-'  ), and the Hash class are going to do the rest.
